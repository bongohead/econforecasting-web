					<p class="card-text">
					<strong>What does this index measure?</strong><br>
					This index tracks the level of correlation between different asset classes in the macroeconomy; e.g. the correlation between stocks and bonds, bonds and real estate, and so on. The full list of tracked asset classes is available <a href='ac-assets-hm'>here</a>. When the index level is high, it means that different asset classes are moving closely with one another.
					</p>
					<p class="card-text">
					<strong>Why is this useful?</strong><br>
					In economic downturns, a sell-off in one asset class can trigger broader sell-offs in other asset classes, causing a contagion effect triggering a larger financial crisis. For example, during the global financial crisis, declines in real estate prices triggered sell-offs in mortgage-backed bonds and later equity prices. This index measures the degree of "danger" that a crisis in one asset class may infect the broader financial market.
					<br>
					Additionally, the level of cross-asset correlation in the economy is a leading indicator for bubbles and economic downturns. Cross-asset correlations are typically high when investors are "searching for yield" - i.e., the demand for one asset has spilled over into general markets, which can lead to a general bubble in financial assets.
					</p>
					<p class="card-text">
					<strong>How do I interpret this index?</strong><br>
					This index tracks the strength of cross-asset correlations between major asset classes in the international economy. The index is normalized to a level between zero and one hundred. High index values indicate that cross-asset return correlations are unusually high and the risk of a broad financial crash is high.
