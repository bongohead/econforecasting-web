					<strong>What does this index measure?</strong><br>
					This index tracks the level of correlation between stock prices in different international economies; e.g. the correlation between the U.S. stock market and the Chinese stck market, and so on. The full list of tracked regions is available <a href='ac-regions-hm'>here</a>. When the index level is high, it means that different regional financial markets are moving closely with one another.
					</p>
					<p class="card-text">
					<strong>Why is this useful?</strong><br>
					In economic downturns, a sell-off in one country's stock market can trigger broader sell-offs in other countries, causing a contagion effect triggering a larger financial crisis. For example, during the global financial crisis, the crash in the U.S. stock market spread to infect countries globally. This index measures the degree of "danger" that a crisis in one country may infect the broader international financial market.
					</p>
					<p class="card-text">
					<strong>How do I interpret this index?</strong><br>
					This index tracks the strength of cross-regional stock market correlations between the world's major economies. The index is normalized to a level between zero and one hundred. High index values indicate that cross-regional return correlations are unusually high and the risk of a global financial crash is elevated.
