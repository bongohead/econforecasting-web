									<p>This page provides monthly forecasts of the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), a major <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/referencerate.asp">benchmark interest rate</a> in the world economy. 
									The rate measures the cost of overnight inter-bank borrowing rates for loans collaterized by Treasury securities. 
									SOFR was created in 2019 as a replacement for the London interbank offered rate (Libor) following the 
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libor_scandal">2012 Libor rate manipulation scandal</a>.</p>
								{% elseif varname == 'ffr' %}
									<p>This page provides monthly forecasts of the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS">federal funds rate</a>, the short-term

									and is the primary rate considered by the Federal Reserve when deciding monetary policy.</p>
									<p>Both historical data and forecasted values on this page reflect period average values.</p>
								{% elseif varname == 'ameribor' %}

									London interbank offer rate (Libor).</p>
									<p>Both historical data and forecasted values on this page reflect period average values.</p>

								{% elseif varname == 'sonia' %}

									<p>Both historical data and forecasted values on this page reflect period average values.</p>
								{% elseif varname == 'estr' %}
									<p>This page provides monthly forecasts of the Euro short-term rate (&euro;STR), a benchmark of the short-term

									Unlike most risk-free rate benchmarkes, the &euro;STR reflects not just interbank lending, 
									but lending between banks, insurers, and money market funds.<p>

									<p>This page provides monthly forecasts of U.S. Treasury bond yields. With over $20 trillion outstanding, Treasury bonds constitute nearly 15% of the global bond market and are the premier safe assets in many

									<p>Our <span class="fw-medium"><i class="cmefi-logo mx-1"></i>Market Consensus Forecast</span> is a model that calculates the average "market expected" forecast of U.S. Treasury yield rates.</p>
									<p>It is derived using current <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/Pages/index.aspx">Treasury bond market data</a> as well as futures market data. 
									In particular, we forecast seperately:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>The risk-free rate, using federal funds rate futures;</li>
										<li>The spread of the Treasury yield curve above the risk-free rate; further decomposed into a term premia factor (estimated using the Treasury futures market) and an

									<p>We then combine these forecasts and smooth them using a <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~fdiebold/papers/paper49/Diebold-Li.pdf">3-factor parametrization model</a>, generating the final forecast.
