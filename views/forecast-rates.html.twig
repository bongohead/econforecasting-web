	<p>This page provides monthly forecasts of the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), a major <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/referencerate.asp">benchmark interest rate</a> in the world economy. 
	The rate measures the cost of overnight inter-bank borrowing rates for loans collaterized by Treasury securities. 
	SOFR was created in 2019 as a replacement for the London interbank offered rate (Libor) following the 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libor_scandal">2012 Libor rate manipulation scandal</a>.</p>
{% elseif name == 'forecast-ffr' %}
	<p>This page provides monthly forecasts of the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS">federal funds rate</a>, the short-term 
	lending rate between different banks of cash held at the Federal Reserve. The federal funds rate is a critical benchmark rate in the global economy, 
	and is the primary rate considered by the Federal Reserve when deciding monetary policy.</p>
	<p>Both historical data and forecasted values on this page reflect period average values.</p>
{% elseif name == 'forecast-ameribor' %}
	<p>This page provides monthly forecasts of the overnight <a href="https://ameribor.net/">American Interbank Offered Rate</a>, a benchmark of the short-term 
	lending rate between small and medium sized U.S. banks. The AMERIBOR rate was introduced in 2021 as an alternative to the now-defunct 
	London interbank offer rate (Libor).</p>
	<p>Both historical data and forecasted values on this page reflect period average values.</p>
{% elseif name == 'forecast-bsby' %}
	<p>This page provides monthly forecasts of the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/product/indices/bsby/">Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index</a>, a benchmark of the short-term 
	lending rate between large global banks. The BSBY rate was introduced in 2021 as an alternative to the now-defunct

	<p>Both historical data and forecasted values on this page reflect period average values.</p>
{% elseif name == 'forecast-sonia' %}
	<p>This page provides monthly forecasts of the Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate (SONIA), a measure of overnight lending rates between banks using British

	<p>Both historical data and forecasted values on this page reflect period average values.</p>
{% elseif name == 'forecast-estr' %}
	<p>This page provides monthly forecasts of the Euro short-term rate (&euro;STR), a benchmark of the short-term 
	unsecured lending rate in the euro area. The &euro;STR is used as a standard measure of the risk-free rate in the euro area. 
	Unlike most risk-free rate benchmarkes, the &euro;STR reflects not just interbank lending, 
	but lending between banks, insurers, and money market funds.<p>
	<p>Both historical data and forecasted values on this page reflect period average values.</p>

	tend to perform better for short-term forecasts, while qualitative forecasts tend to be better predictors for long-term forecasts; 
	our model combines these forecasts using a locally linear random forest method to optimize the strengths of each forecast.</p>
