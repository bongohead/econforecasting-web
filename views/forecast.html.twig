									<p>This page provides monthly forecasts of the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), a major <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/referencerate.asp">benchmark interest rate</a> in the world economy. 
									The rate measures the cost of overnight inter-bank borrowing rates for loans collaterized by Treasury securities. 
									SOFR was created in 2019 as a replacement for the London interbank offered rate (Libor) following the

									<p>It is derived using current <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/Pages/index.aspx">Treasury bond market data</a> as well as futures market data. 
									In particular, we forecast seperately:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>The risk-free rate, using federal funds rate futures;</li>
										<li>The spread of the Treasury yield curve above the risk-free rate; further decomposed into a term premia factor (estimated using the Treasury futures market) and an

										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>We then combine these forecasts and smooth them using a <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~fdiebold/papers/paper49/Diebold-Li.pdf">3-factor parametrization model</a>, generating the final forecast.
									 The forecast can be considered an approximation of the market-average expected yield.</p>
